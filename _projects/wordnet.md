- Involved creating the back-end to find word hyponym relationships ("is-a" word) and synonyms to display on a web-based application. 
- Wordnet allows users to query for certain words for visual representations of word hiearchies and historical trends through the front end. [More details here.](https://fa24.datastructur.es/projects/proj2b/)
- Implemented the backend with custom directed graph data structures, and timeseries maps in order to allow the user to query large atasets for hyponyms and usage rates of words over certain times.
